**flutter_stripe_payment** has been discontinued - a new plugin called [flutter_stripe](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_stripe) should be used instead:

# Main changes

- support for [Payment Sheet](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=android)
- support for many more [payment providers](https://github.com/flutter-stripe/flutter_stripe/blob/main/stripe_platform_interface/lib/src/models/payment_methods.dart#L36)
- [PCI compliant](https://stripe.com/en-de/guides/pci-compliance), SCA-Ready with [3D Secure authentication](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/3d-secure)
- integration with the [Pay](https://pub.dev/packages/pay) plugin
- documentation, support and regular updates
